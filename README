Give detailed instructions for how to run your code here. Be sure to indicate where all of your data sets are located on the CS system.

To start the program, use the following command line: python3 PlayGame.py checkers player1 player2
the options for the players are as follows:
random, which makes random moves
mcts, which makes moves generated by monte carlo tree search
human, which allows for user selected moves.
to specify the number of rollouts for an mcts player, you can use command lines similar to the following:

to give player1 1000 rollouts and player 2 10 rollouts:
python3 PlayGame.py checkers mcts mcts -a1 1000 -a2 10

to give player 1 1000 rollouts:
python3 PlayGame.py hex mcts human -a1 1000

for human players, you will be presented with the moves in a list in the following format:

move number : (y, x, dy, dx)

y and x represent the position of a piece, with 0,0 being on the top left of the board and 5,5 being at the bottom right of the board.
dy is the change in that piece's y coordinate as a result of the move, and dx is the change in the x coordinate.
For example, move (3, 3, -1, -1) would move the piece at 3,3 to 2,2.
